# Support project

Hello, and thank you for checking out my project. As the creator, I am currently in a difficult financial situation, and your support would mean the world to me.

This project has been a labour of love, and I have spent countless hours working on it in hope that it provides value to its users and contributes to the open-source community.

If you have found this project helpful or inspiring, please consider supporting its continued development. Every donation helps, no matter how small.

You can find a list of donation methods, including Boosty, Yoomoney, and cryptocurrencies, on my [SUPPORT.md](https://github.com/Brawaru/Brawaru/blob/main/SUPPORT.md) page.

Thank you for your support, it means everything to me.
